ðŸ“Œ Project Description
Event Management Platform (Angular + Spring Boot)

This is a full-stack web application developed using Angular and Spring Boot. The project simulates an event management system where users can register, log in, join events, leave comments, and manage personal information. Organizers can create and manage events, while admins have full control over all users and events in the system.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:

User authentication with role-based access (USER / ORGANIZER / ADMIN)

Event creation, editing, and deletion for organizers and admins

Event registration for regular users

Comment section on each event, with live updates and user details

Animated toast notifications for actions (login, logout, create, edit, delete)

Account page for updating user data (email, password)

Admin panel with user and event management

Fully responsive UI with modern styling

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose: This project was built to explore and test full-stack web development using Angular and Spring Boot. It helped reinforce concepts like role-based authorization, DTO-entity mapping, frontend-backend integration, and clean UI design with dynamic feedback.
